Okay so any bright ideas??
I think we should do power to people app lol
I think that is too much work? How about just deleting or moving files
how about sorting files in a folder by file type like docx, txt or pdf

Our proposal:
We are going to access the directory of different folders through the cmd line.
We will create files through the cmd line and add data to the files through vi and read everything using Netbeans.
We can fill the files with different tools and users. This will go with the power to people app idea.
